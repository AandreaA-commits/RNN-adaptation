- RLC_generate_*.py: generate the dataset for:
    - train: train the neural network model
    - test: test the neural network model
    - transfer: adapt the linearized (GP-like) model using the nominal model's Jacobian to generate the features
    - eval: evaluate the performance of the linearized GP-like model on new data

- RLC_train.py: fit a dynoNet model on the training dataset
- RLC_transfer_parspace_naive.py: adapt the linearized model in parameter space building the Jacobian matrix explicitly
